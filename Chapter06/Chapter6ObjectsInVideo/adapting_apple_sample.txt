To use the apple sample. First download and unzip it from https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture


Create a new empty app.

Edit your ViewController.swift to have the same contents as the apple one
Copy the VisionObjectRecognitionViewController.swift file from their project to yours
In Main.storyboard, change the name of the View to Preview View
In Main.storyboard, change the name of the class to VisionObjectRecognitionViewController
In Main.storyboard, create an outlet from Preview View to ViewController and call it previewView
Delete the code in ViewController.swift that was previously doing the outlet
Edit Info.plist and add a ‘Privacy - Camera Usage Description’ node with some text describing your app
Add the ObjectDetector.mlmodel from the apple sample to yours, and it should work now!
